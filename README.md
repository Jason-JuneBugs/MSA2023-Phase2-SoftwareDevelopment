# MSA2023-Phase2-SoftwareDevelopment

## Brief

This is to simulate a NASA mission control board. The application will allow users to view, create, update and delete a collection of items. You have the creative freedom to decide what type of items your mission control app will "house":

- planets
- launches
- all of the above or something else!

## Getting Started


### Fire the app locally in Docker
cd into your project root folder, then run:

```zsh
docker-compose up --build
```
when the app is spinned up, you can access the homepage from
http://localhost:3000
